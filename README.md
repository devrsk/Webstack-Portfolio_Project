## Description

PropertyPro is a web application designed to streamline the process of buying, selling, and managing properties. It provides users with the ability to search for properties based on various criteria, view property details, and manage their own property listings. The system also includes user registration and authentication functionality to ensure secure access.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the development process of a real estate management system using Node.js and Express.js.
- Learn how to implement user registration and authentication using bcrypt for password hashing and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication.
- Gain knowledge of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing properties in a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- Understand the integration of image uploads for property images using Multer.
- Explore the use of middleware functions for handling authentication and other common tasks.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of server-side applications.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing property and user data.
- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB that provides a straightforward schema-based solution for managing data.
- bcrypt: A library for hashing passwords to ensure secure storage and authentication.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): A standard for creating access tokens used for authentication and authorization.
- Multer: A middleware for handling file uploads, in this case, for property images.
- Cors: A middleware that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to handle requests from different origins.
- Dotenv: A module for loading environment variables from a .env file.

## Challenges Identified

- Time Constraints: Building a fully functional application in less than two weeks can be challenging, so careful planning and prioritizations are essential.
- Design and User Experience: Creating an appealing and intuitive user interface to enhance the shopping experience.
- Handling image uploads for property images: Integrating Multer middleware to handle file uploads, validating file types, and managing file storage.
- Implementing CRUD operations for managing properties: Designing and implementing the necessary routes and database interactions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting properties within the application.
